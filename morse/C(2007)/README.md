#Morse/C
### December 5, 2007

So I found this extremely old code in C that I remember gave me a bit of trouble. It's a simple, command line morse code encoder/decoder. Here I've included the original unmodified code from *2007*. I've just removed the sensitive information from the coments. The code is unchanged but I will say that I feel there's a lot of room for improvement on this C code. Fun ahead!
