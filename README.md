======
I'm using this repo to work on special projects accross different languages. I may take old projects I've worked on and bring them here in order to keep the code somewhere. The main focus will be implementing the same project using different languages so as to compare and learn tradeoffs.

###[Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)](/AES)
Implementations:

* [PHP](/AES/PHP)
* [Ruby](/AES/Ruby)
* [C](/AES/C)
