#AES/JavaScript
### November 24, 2014

This is the fourth AES implementation I work on. Just as with the previous ones I will follow the Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 197 [FIPS 197](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips197/fips-197.pdf) by the National Institute of Standards and Technology to implement this. There's a lot of considerations that I had to make with C that I didn't with Ruby. JavaScript will probably be in between those worlds as it has built-in functions that can help but not as many as Ruby.
