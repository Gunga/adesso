#AES/PHP
### ~March 25, 2013
This is the first AES implementation I worked on. I enjoyed working on it quite a bit. There was a lot to think about. At the time I was working with a lot PHP so I decided to further my understanding of the language by implementing something like this. I followed the Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 197 [FIPS 197](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips197/fips-197.pdf) by the National Institute of Standards and Technology to implement this. So far the cipher works fine but maybe it can benefit from some refactoring. I made a **tester.php** file with markup and a simple form so others could test it on their browsers. Although I may eventually fix this, I will first attempt implementing it using other languages.
