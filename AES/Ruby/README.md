#AES/Ruby
### November 13, 2014
This is the second AES implementation I work on. The first one was PHP. Just as with that one I followed the Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 197 [FIPS 197](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips197/fips-197.pdf) by the National Institute of Standards and Technology to implement this. I will update any findings as I work on it.
