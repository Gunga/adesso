#AES/C
### November 16, 2014

This is the third AES implementation I work on. Just as with the previous ones I will follow the Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 197 [FIPS 197](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips197/fips-197.pdf) by the National Institute of Standards and Technology to implement this. This implementation will probably take the longest time as typecasting and memory allocation should be taken into account. Furthermore, where Ruby and PHP have useful methods for handling certain data structures, C has a limited ammount. Therefore, I will have to implement certain methods (such as split) myself.
